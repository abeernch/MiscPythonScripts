import re

# Sample text with repeated words
text = "This is is a sample text with repeated repeated words."

# Regex pattern with backreferencing to match repeated words
pattern = r"\b(\w+)\s+\1\b"

# Explanation:
# \b: Asserts a word boundary (beginning or end of a word).
# (\w+): Capturing group that matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores).
# \s+: Matches one or more whitespace characters.
# \1: Backreference to the first captured group, ensuring that the same word is repeated.

# Find all repeated words
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print("Repeated words:", matches)  # Output: ['is', 'repeated']
