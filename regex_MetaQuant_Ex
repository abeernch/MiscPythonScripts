import re

# Sample text containing emails
text = "Please contact us at support@example.com or sales@example.org for assistance."

# Regex pattern to match email addresses
pattern = r"\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,7}\b"

# Explanation:
# \b: Asserts a word boundary (the beginning or end of a word).
# [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+: Matches one or more alphanumeric characters and special characters often found in emails.
# @: Matches the '@' symbol.
# [A-Za-z0-9.-]+: Matches one or more characters that are typically found in the domain name.
# \.: Escapes the dot (.) character.
# [A-Z|a-z]{2,7}: Matches between 2 and 7 alphabetic characters (the domain suffix, like .com or .org).
# \b: Asserts a word boundary at the end.

# Find all email addresses
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print("Emails found:", matches)  # Output: ['support@example.com', 'sales@example.org']
