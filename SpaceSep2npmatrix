# In the event a space-separated input has to be converted into a matrix use the following script
# The first input gives the space-separated dimension of the matrix
# The second input are the elements

# Example:
# Dimension input =  2 4
# matrix elements =  1 2 3 4
#                    5 6 7 8

# n, m = 2, 4
# A = array[[1 2 3 4]
#           [5 6 7 8]] 


import numpy as np
n, m = map(int, input().split())                                        # split the input elements as list elements and apply the map function to convert each into an integer
A = numpy.array([list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)])    # Apply the same as above to create a list with independent elements which is then converted into a numpy array. 
                                                                        # This time, conversion into a list is recommended as indindual int can not be converted into a np array. Following this, 
                                                                        # apply list comprehension to determine where the next row of the matrix begins
