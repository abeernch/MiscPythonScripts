import re

# Sample text
text = "apple orange apple orange apple orange"

# Regex pattern with a non-capturing group (?:) for 'apple'
pattern = r"(?:apple)\s(orange)"

# Explanation:
# (?:apple): Non-capturing group that matches 'apple'. The ?: indicates that this group should not be captured for later use.
# \s: Matches a space character.
# (orange): Capturing group that matches 'orange'.

# Find matches
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print("Matches:", matches)  # Output: ['orange', 'orange', 'orange']
